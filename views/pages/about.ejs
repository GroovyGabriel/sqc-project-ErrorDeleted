  <p>This project will result in a database-backed website that 
    logs information about what items are up for sale and their 
    details. This will also keep info on each account and their 
    items logs.

    This is inspired from <a href="https://warframe.market/">Warframe Market</a>.<em>I don't claim that 
    site nor do I wish to commerically use this website. I wish 
    to just simulate their design from a different approuch.</em></p>
    <p>This is the proposal navigation:</p>
